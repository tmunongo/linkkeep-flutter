# linkkeep

I needed a place to keep all the links to blogs that I love to read.

And, yes, I have heard of bookmarks. But, they tie me to a browser and force me to set up cloud sync and give daddy Google all my personal data.

I think this is better. It's like Pocket, if Pocket served this very, very specific need that I have.

Anyways, its for personal use.

For now ;)
